# Build a chat app with Angular

This is an example application that demonstrates how to write a simple chat application with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), Angular and Node. For more information, you can check out a more detailed [blog post on the topic](https://pusher.com/tutorials/chat-angular/), which uses this code as an example.

This repo contains two applications. A server Node application `chat-app-server` and an front end Angular application `chat-app-client`.

### Instructions
You can find instructions on how to run both applications in their both respecitve directories.
